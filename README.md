# 🚀 Find me elsewhere 

Since the beginning of my career as a software developer, I've hosted my code on GitHub. For a long time, it was the natural home for everyone's projects.

But the world has changed—a lot. And so has GitHub. It's not what it used to be. Now wearing its Big Tech hat, it has started to show its guns against developers who don't "comply." So, I moved all my humble projects elsewhere.

This made the obvious explicit: our code—whether it's a bit messy, a bit trashy, or actually good—can be locked in at any time, with us, the actual owners, locked out. They can then do whatever they want with it, and by "whatever," I mean profit.

To guarantee my work remains mine, I am no longer hosting on GitHub. I've found a new home that feels safer for now. You can contact me via the link below to ask for the new address; I'll be glad to share it.

Bye! 👋
