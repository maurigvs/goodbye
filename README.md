# 🚀 Find me elsewhere 

Since the beggining of my Software Developer career, I used to host my code projects on Github. After all (still) is the natural place where everybody's code is.

But since then, the world change. Like, a lot. And Github changed. Is not what is was. Now, it wears the Big Tech Hat and has started to show its guns againts Developers that do not "comply". So I moved all my humble stuff elsewhere. It turns out, the obvious became now, explicit. Our bit messy, bit trashy or actually good Code can, at anytime Github judges necessary, be locked-in and we, the actual owners of it, locked-out. And they can do wherever they want with it (and by "wherever they want, I mean, profit").

So, to guarantee that my stuff continues to be mine, I'm not hosting anymore in Github. I found another home which makes me feel safer (for now). You can contact me via the link below and ask for the new address, I'll be glad to share :)

Bye! 👋
